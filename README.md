# leaflet-map

*leaflet-map* is a web-component which provides access to the [leaflet map](http://leafletjs.com)
JavaScript library via html elements.

Please have a look at the [demo](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-map/demo.html) or the [api documentation](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-map/doc.html#leaflet-map).

Most of the options documented in the Leaflet reference are exported as html attributes.
All events are mapped into html events of the same name.</p>
For example use &lt;leaflet-map latitude="51.505" longitude="-0.09" zoom="13"&gt; &lt;/leaflet-map&gt;
to define the view and zoom level.


## Quickstart Guide

Make leaflet maps using declarative web components.
To get started read the [documentation](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-map/doc.html)
or checkout the [demo](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-map/).

Install this web component using [npm](https://npm.im/leaflet-element):

```
npm i -S leaflet-element
```

Import the main component and start creating your map:

```js
import 'leaflet-element'
```
```html
  <head>
    <style>
      html, body {
        margin: 0;
        height: 100%;
      }
      leaflet-map {
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <leaflet-map fit-to-markers>
      <leaflet-marker longitude="77.2" latitude="28.4">
        Marker I
      </leaflet-marker>
      <leaflet-circle longitude="77.2" latitude="28.4" radius="300">
        Round
      </leaflet-circle>
    </leaflet-map>
  </body>
```

## Notes for implementing child elements

Child elements like markers or layers will be initialized by the surrounding container
(the map or a layer) by setting a "container" javascript property.
Therefore the child element should define a `containerChanged` method and use that as initializer.
Don't forget to define a `disconnectedCallback` method that calls `super.disconnectedCallback`
to perform any necessary clean up. The leaflet-marker element is a good template.
